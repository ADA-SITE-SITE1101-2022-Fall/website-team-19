                Several things happen when you type our address into your browser and press Enter:

                The URL gets resolved
                Your browser sends a request to the server of the website
                The website sends a response which is then parsed
                Your browser processes the site and displays it
                When you enter the domain htmlpreview.github.io, the browser converts it into the Ip address using the DNS (Domain Name System) server of the server it should send request to. Then, the browser sends a request and gets data via HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS is the protocol full URL (for example, https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADA-SITE-SITE1101-2022-Fall/website-team-19/main/Project.html) contains in its beginning. Further, when the server responds, the response's data and metadata are examined and the browser makes a decision based on that. After all of those steps are done, the site is finally displayed. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) specifies the structure and informs the browser whether material belongs in a headline, an image, etc. Therefore, screen readers obtain most of the information from the HTML structure.

                On our website, you can see four panels on the top right. The first one, “Main”, is our main page, in other words, index.html. It shows what we have done while dealing with our event. The second one, "Event", leads to the page with a short report about our school lesson and provides pictures and video from it. The next one is “About us”, it opens a page where people can read short information about participants of our team. Finally, "Website", is a short guide to our site.
