                    <h3> My name is Farrukh Mammad.</h3>
                    <p>I am 17 years old and I study electrical engineering at ADA university.
                        For almost all 17 years of my life, I was fond of alternative and indie music, such as shoegaze, midwest, drain, etc.
                        I am also interested in amateur, non-professional, and indie movies. Moreover, I used to be a basketball player, but unfortunately, I quit this sport about a year ago.</p>

                    <h3> My name is Aysu Azammadova.</h3>
                     <p>This year is already my second year at ADA, and in the first year, I joined the English for Academic Purposes Program (EAPP) to improve my English.
                        Ultimately, this year I started the education system necessary for my major.
                        By the way, let me mention that my specialty is Information Technology.
                        My area of interest is mainly in the renaissance of technology.
                        New, improved, or never-before-seen inventions led me to choose this field.
                        As for my other interests and hobbies, although I'm not a person who likes to be in very social and crowded places, I like to discuss and exchange ideas with my close friends under some headings.
                        My hobbies include playing the piano as well. I participated in the piano course for 7 years starting from the 3rd grade and completed the course with high achievement in the 9th grade.</p>

                        My faculty is Computer Science and I'm interested in leaving something after me to the world by investing something new.
                        My hobbies are playing piano, drawing and playing tennis.</p>
